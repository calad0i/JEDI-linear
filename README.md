# Reproduction Instructions

Install environment

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate jedi-linear
```

### Download and prepare dataset

```bash
bash prepare_dataset.sh
```


### Obtaining the models

The models shown in the tables in the papers are included in `offline_models.tar.gz`.
You can extract them with:

```bash
tar -xvf offline_models.tar.gz
```

If you want to retrain the models, you can do so with the following commands.
This will launch a whole Pareto scan, so many models will be saved.

```bash
KERAS_BACKEND=jax python jet_classifier.py -c configs/<config_file> -r train
```

### Evaluation on test set, convert to Verilog

The outputs are already included in the `offline_models.tar.gz`, but you can validate them with:

```bash
KERAS_BACKEND=jax python jet_classifier.py -c configs/<config_file> -r test verilog
```

### Synthesis

Due to size consideration, we removed the Vivado project files, but only included the gererated reports.

```bash
cd <output_directory>/<model_directory>/da4ml_verilog_prjs/<verilog_project>
vivado -mode batch -source synth_prj.tcl
```

### Generate json report

Using the included `load_summary.py` script in the tarball, you can generate the json report from all the synthesis results:

```bash
cd <output_directory>
for p in *-feature*; do
    for N in 8 16 32 64 128; do
        name=$(basename $p)
        for f in $p/*$N; do python3 load_summary.py -e $f/test_acc.json $f/da4ml_verilog_prjs/* -o summary/$N-particle-$name.json; done
    done
done
```

# JEDI-linear - General Instructions


This repository contains the code for the paper "JEDI-linear: Fast and Efficient Graph Neural Networks for Jet Tagging on FPGAs" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15468). The code can be run as follows:

1. Clone the repository, install the dependencies. Also install one of the backends for training (`jax`, `tensorflow`, or `pytorch`)
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install <your_backend>
   ```
2. Download the dataset from https://zenodo.org/records/3602260
3. Extract the training and testing (the validation split downloaded), prepare them with
   ```bash
   python prepare_dataset.py -i /tmp/<train/validation>/ -o /tmp/<train/test>.h5 -j <n_processes>
   ```
   Place both `train.h5` and `test.h5` in the same directory, e.g., `/tmp/jet_data/`.
4. Modifying the configs to have the `datapath` point to the dataset directory, and change the output directory `save_path` if needed.
5. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   KERAS_BACKEND=<YOUR_BACKEND> python jet_classifier -c <CONFIG_FILE> -r train test verilog
   ```
   where `<YOUR_BACKEND>` can be `jax`, `tensorflow`, or `torch` depending on the backend you installed.
   The configs are located in `configs/`.
   The `-n$number` part of the config file is the maximum number of particles to be used; `-3` means only `pt, eta, phi` are used, otherwise all 16 features are used; `uq1` means the network is uniformly quantized over the particle dimension and is permutation-invariant.
